## Features

### Synchronized Natures

When a player has a Pokémon on their team that has Synchronize as its ability, there is a chance that Pokémon spawning nearby will spawn with the same nature as that trainer Pokémon. This is the main games’ out-of-combat effect for the Synchronize ability brought to Cobblemon.

### Config Options

In the config, you can specify:

`mustBeFirst`

Whether or not the Pokémon with Synchronize must be the first Pokémon in the player’s party in order to be considered. If this is false, the mod will look for the first Pokémon with Synchronize in a player’s party and use that.

`effectiveRange`

The distance in blocks at which a spawning Pokémon will take into account a nearby player.

`marbles` / `chance`

These two work together to figure out your chances. You have `chance` in `marbles` chances. So, for the default config, you have a 1 in 2 (50%) chance.
